:c:func:`PyUnicode_InternInPlace` no longer prevents its argument from being
garbage collected.

Several functions that take ``char *`` are now
documented as possibly preventing string objects from being garbage
collected; refer to their documentation for details:
:c:func:`PyUnicode_InternFromString`,
:c:func:`PyDict_SetItemString`,
:c:func:`PyObject_SetAttrString`,
:c:func:`PyObject_DelAttrString`,
:c:func:`PyUnicode_InternFromString`,
and ``PyModule_Add*`` convenience functions.

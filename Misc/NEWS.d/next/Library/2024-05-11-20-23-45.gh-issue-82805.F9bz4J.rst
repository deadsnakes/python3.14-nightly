Support single-dot file extensions in :attr:`pathlib.PurePath.suffix` and
related attributes and methods. For example, the
:attr:`~pathlib.PurePath.suffixes` of ``PurePath('foo.bar.')`` are now
``['.bar', '.']`` rather than ``[]``. This brings file extension splitting
in line with :func:`os.path.splitext`.

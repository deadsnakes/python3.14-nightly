Hard-coded breakpoints (:func:`breakpoint` and :func:`pdb.set_trace()`) now
reuse the most recent ``Pdb`` instance that calls ``Pdb.set_trace()``,
instead of creating a new one each time. As a result, all the instance specific
data like ``display`` and ``commands`` are preserved across Hard-coded breakpoints.

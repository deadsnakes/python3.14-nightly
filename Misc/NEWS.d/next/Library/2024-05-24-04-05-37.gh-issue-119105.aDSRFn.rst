``difflib``'s ``DIffer.compare()`` (and so also ``ndiff``) can no longer be provoked into cubic-time behavior, or into unbounded recursion, and should generally be faster in ordinary cases too. Results may change in some cases, although that should be rare. Correctness of diffs is not affected. Some similar lines far apart may be reported as deleting one and adding the other, where before they were displayed on adjacent output lines with markup showing the intraline differences.
